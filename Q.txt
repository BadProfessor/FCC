Customer (or consumer) identity and access management (CIAM) is a subset of the larger concept of identity access management (IAM) and is focused specifically on managing the identities of customers who need access to corporate websites, web portals and webshops.[1][2] Instead of managing user accounts in every instance of a software application of a company, the identity is managed in a CIAM component, making reuse of the identity possible. The biggest differentiator between CIAM and regular (internal) IAM is that in CIAM the consumers of the service manage their own accounts and profile data. [3]

A customer data platform (CDP) is a collection of software which creates a persistent, unified customer database that is accessible to other systems. Data is pulled from multiple sources, cleaned and combined to create a single customer profile. This structured data is then made available to other marketing systems.[1] According to Gartner, customer data platforms have evolved from a variety of mature markets, "including multichannel campaign management, tag management and data integration."[2]

ERP

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14W-qXZvdKQ
A data management platform (DMP) is a software platform used for collecting and managing data. They allow businesses to identify audience segments, which can be used to target specific users and contexts in online advertising campaigns. DMPs may use big data and artificial intelligence algorithms to process and analyze large data sets about users from various sources.[1] Some advantages of using DMPs include data organization, increased insight on audiences and markets, and effective advertisement budgeting.[2] On the other hand, DMPs often have to deal with privacy concerns due to the integration of third-party software with private data. This technology is continuously being developed by global entities such as Nielsen and Oracle.[3]

Shell
https://bigstep.com/blog/top-5-linux-shells-and-how-to-install-them
The shell is an interactive interface that allows users to execute other commands and utilities in Linux and other UNIX-based operating systems. When you login to the operating system, the standard shell is displayed and allows you to perform common operations such as copy files or restart the system.
Linux shells are a lot more powerful than the Windows command line, because they function as a scripting language as well, with a complete set of tools. Multiple shells can be installed on a system and it is possible to quickly switch between them. Every shell comes with its own syntax and scripting features, let’s discuss the most common options and how to install them on a Cent OS 7 server.

Bash
https://bigstep.com/blog/top-5-linux-shells-and-how-to-install-them
Bash, or the Bourne-Again Shell, is by far the most widely used choice and it comes installed as the default shell in the most popular Linux distributions. It was developed from the original UNIX Bourne shell (also known as sh) and was designed to be fully compatible with the old scripts, while adding multiple improved features.
Bash is a very solid shell option, since it has been used for a long time and there is ample documentation for it. In fact, most online tutorials will assume that you’re using bash.
As a result, it is recommended for most users and works great for most common system administration tasks. However, if you need more powerful scripting options or other advanced tools, it is time to explore some of the newer shells available.

Windows Shell
The Windows shell is the graphical user interface for the Microsoft Windows operating system. Its readily identifiable elements consists of the desktop, the taskbar, the Start menu, the task switcher and the AutoPlay feature. On some versions of Windows, it also includes Flip 3D and the charms.

SLA
https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/kpis/sla-vs-slo-vs-sli
An SLA (service level agreement) is an agreement between provider and client about measurable metrics like uptime, responsiveness, and responsibilities. 
These agreements are typically drawn up by a company’s new business and legal teams and they represent the promises you’re making to customers—and the consequences if you fail to live up to those promises. Typically, consequences include financial penalties, service credits, or license extensions.

SLO
https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/kpis/sla-vs-slo-vs-sli
An SLO (service level objective) is an agreement within an SLA about a specific metric like uptime or response time. So, if the SLA is the formal agreement between you and your customer, SLOs are the individual promises you’re making to that customer. SLOs are what set customer expectations and tell IT and DevOps teams what goals they need to hit and measure themselves against.

SLI
https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/kpis/sla-vs-slo-vs-sli
An SLI (service level indicator) measures compliance with an SLO (service level objective). So, for example, if your SLA specifies that your systems will be available 99.95% of the time, your SLO is likely 99.95% uptime and your SLI is the actual measurement of your uptime. Maybe it’s 99.96%. Maybe 99.99%. To stay in compliance with your SLA, the SLI will need to meet or exceed the promises made in that document.
