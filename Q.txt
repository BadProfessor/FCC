Customer (or consumer) identity and access management (CIAM) is a subset of the larger concept of identity access management (IAM) and is focused specifically on managing the identities of customers who need access to corporate websites, web portals and webshops.[1][2] Instead of managing user accounts in every instance of a software application of a company, the identity is managed in a CIAM component, making reuse of the identity possible. The biggest differentiator between CIAM and regular (internal) IAM is that in CIAM the consumers of the service manage their own accounts and profile data. [3]
